# Troubleshooting

In windows playback device configuration, leave `Disable all enhancements` unchecked.  

Install and Viper4Windows in administrator mode.  

Make sure that the output device is enabled in `Configurator`.  

If not working in the first place, install `Equalizer APO` (but don't use it). This application somehow triggers the correct Windows settings.
